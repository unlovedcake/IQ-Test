Question 1.

Answer : As I can see last row of right corner, in order to be balanced the pattern the answer would be number 2 \


Question 2.

Answer : In the top 2nd column I choose the number 1 diamond small size and in the last row bottom right corner, I choose the number 2 large square.
		For me, I would rather have the same size for each column and the same alignment from small, medium, and large rows. Because the number 3 large square is not a good idea to put that in 2nd top column.

Question 3.

Answer : My answer is number 2 in first column last left corner bottom   and number 4 for 2nd column in bottom middle, in order to have the same size for each row and then same pairing.


Question 4.

Answer : My answer is number 4. If you look at the square black and circle white they are  the appropriate pattern to put on in the last
		column bottom right corner in order to maintain the balance.

Question 5.

Answer : My answer is that 2nd column bottom middle is number 1 and the last column bottom right corner is number 4. Because it would maintain the same alignment top height of the square for each row.
